# Predicting the salary of a future recruit
## HR Analytics:
###EDA, Data Visualuzation and Regression Analysis:

- Predicting salaries of new recruits, by creatig a model that learns from the historical salaries data. In addition, identify the correlation of salaries and different variables like education, major and bring out actionable insights from the existing dataset.

>The data is a reflection of job postings within one city and it is assumed that it is a reflection of an extrapolated population of the city. The impending model will be assumed to work on similar datasets.


a) What are we analyzing:

>In the first step, correlation between the different variables of the training dataset and has been analyzed and inferences, written down. These variables include Industry, jobtype, type of major.

b) What the variables mean:

>The different variables signify the different attributes a person can have, like the industry he/she is employed in, the type of job, type of major completed and the years of work experience that the person has.

c) Why is this data set being analyzed:

>To develop a working model that can be deployed and used to predict the salaries of future recruits and ths aid in the recruitment process.

- Summary results:
>Exploratory Data Analysis in Python on salaries data of different job profiles. Built a baseline Linear Regression Model to achieve a Mean Squared Error of 410 and improved it by implementing Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting to achieve a final Mean squared Error of 370.
